# Our Snack obstacle sensor


Hello everyone, 


Here is our arduino project. 


The whole week, me and my team worked on a obstacle sensor. 



The concept is that when you comes into contact with the sensor, the screen show 
two midlle lines of red leds who disappears into two little snakes. 



If you want to know more about it, please have a seat and enjoy our work !
